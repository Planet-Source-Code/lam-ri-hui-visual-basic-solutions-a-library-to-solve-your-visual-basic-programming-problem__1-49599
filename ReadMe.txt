Hi there everybody. This is my second tutorial on Planet Source Code. I tried to make this the best I could and I hope you will like it. This article is pure in HTML. It contains questions and answers about some difficult Visual Basic Solution. There aren't much graphics I used in this article. If you liked this please vote for me. If you don't like, please leave comments why you don't like. Thank you. There are some people who didn't do anything but submit impolite comments on the people who submitted their tutorial, article or projects. They shouldn't do this to programmers that need encourage and supports. OK, that's all. Wish you enjoy this article while I enjoy writing it.
